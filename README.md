ASSIGNMENT 1

project title - Car Renter

Description - Car Renter is a mobile app that aims to provide a convenient platform for individuals to rent and share their personal cars with others. The app connects car owners with those who want to rent cars for short-term use for purposes like trips, errands, or transportation needs. It aims to increase utilization, reduce the need for car ownership, and promote a more cost-effective transportation solution by enabling renting rather than buying a car intended for short-term use.

What the app tries to solve- This app addresses the problem of underutilized personal cars and reduces the need to buy new vehicles. Many individuals own cars that remain idle for significant periods, resulting in wasted resources. Additionally, not everyone requires a car full-time and may prefer a more flexible and affordable alternative to traditional car rentals. It bridges this gap by providing a platform that enables car owners to earn money from their idle cars and offers renters a convenient and cost-effective means of accessing a vehicle for their specific needs.

Functions to be implemented- User Registration- account creation functionality for both car owners and those who want to rent. Users sign in secure login to the system enabling only authenticated users to interact with the system. Car Profile Creation: Car owners can create detailed profiles for their vehicles, including specifications, photos, and availability. Booking and Reservation: Renters can request car bookings and specify rental duration, locations, and addresses. In-App Messaging: Communication system allowing drivers and passengers to discuss rental details, coordinate pick-up/drop-off, and address any queries. Payment Integration: Secure payment processing for rental transactions, including options for rental fees, security deposits, and any additional charges. Trip History: Maintain a record of past rentals for both drivers and passengers, including details of previous transactions.

Risks involved- Competition Sabotaging: Competitors may engage in unethical practices such as fake bookings User Resistance: Users may be hesitant to share their personal vehicles or rely on someone else's car. Internet Access Cost: High data costs or limited internet access in certain regions may impact user adoption
